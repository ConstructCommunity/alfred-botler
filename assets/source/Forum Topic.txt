The Construct Community is a free Discord server for game developers and those interested in getting into it, using [i]Construct Classic[/i], [i]Construct 2[/i] and [i]Construct 3[/i].
([url=https://discordapp.com/]Discord[/url] itself is kind of like an IRC Client and Teamspeak combined with a modern interface.)[hr]

[h2]Why should I join the Construct Community?[/h2]
[h3]► Friendly & Helpful Community[/h3]
With over 1000 members (about 150 active members every day), there is always someone around to provide you with quick help or to have a friendly and informative discussion with.

[h3]► Multiple text & voice channels[/h3]
We offer a number of text channels such as: #general, #help, #sdk and many more. Voice channels are also available for all sorts of conversations.

[h3]► Instantly share files & images[/h3]
All members are allowed to upload and share files and images. Makes sharing free addons or examples for reproduction simple and fast.

[h3]► Roles & member mentions[/h3]
If you would like to let other members know that you have a special talent, if you are for example an [i]artist[/i] or perhaps a Construct [i]expert[/i]. You can easily add or remove selected roles at any time.

[h3]► An alternative & not a replacement[/h3]
The Construct Community Discord server was not made in order to compete with the official forum! It is just a different medium for fast and punctual interactions.*[hr]
